## Introduction to REST in Drupal 8

### What is REST?

> Web Services make it possible for other applications to read and update information on your site via the Web. REST is one of a number of different ways of making Web Services available on your site. In contrast to other techniques such as SOAP or XML-RPC, REST encourages developers to rely on HTTP methods (such as GET and POST) to operate on site resources.
